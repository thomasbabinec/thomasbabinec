Hi, I'm @thomasbabinec: Scientist, Artist, and Getting-There Coder

My main current (and historical) research interests are nanoscience, data engineering, quantum technologies, and fine art.

I'm currently developing skills in data structures and algorithms in python and SQL though Leetcode.com and DataCamp.com.

I can be reached at my email thomasbabinec@gmail.com.
