Hi, I'm @thomasbabinec: Scientist, Artist, and Getting-There Coder

I'm interested in nanoscience, data engineering, quantum technologies, and fine art.

I'm currently learning data structures and algorithms in python though Leetcode.com and DataCamp.com.

I can be reached at my email thomasbabinec@gmail.com.
